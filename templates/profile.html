            <h5>This is your account, </h5>
            <p>You can start by exploring the page by using the navigation at the top where you will find all recipes
                under the name recipes. Or you can add a recipe yourself that you also find at the top of the page
                (add recipe) or click the button below. All you need to think about then is to follow the form and be
                extra careful to separate the ingredients with commas and spaces.<br><br><a class="btn-large"
                    href="{{ url_for('add_recipe') }}">Add
                    recipe</a></p>
            <br>
            <h5>If you wish to delete or edit a recipe,</h5>
            <p>Start then by going to the recipes page as explained above or click on this link <a
                    href="{{ url_for('get_recipe') }}">Recipes</a>.
                There you can then choose to scroll through your recipe or search for it by name or ingredient. Then you
                should see that three buttons are available, edit and delete. Click on what you want and you have the
                opportunity to fix your recipes the way you want them.</p><br>
            <h5> Search for recipes,</h5>
            <p>At the top of the recipes page you will find the search bar that allows you to search by name and
                ingredient/ingredients. If nothing was found when you searched, just click the reset button and all
                available recipes will appear for you again.</p><br>
            <h5>Extra info buttons,</h5>
            <p>In some places in the website there are buttons like this under this text. This shares additional
                infromation that can be good for you as a user to know and sometimes be reminded of. So do not hesitate
                to make sure to click on these at regular intervals.</p>
            <p>Start right now by clicking on this below!</p>
