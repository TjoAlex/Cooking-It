        <p>
            We exist to create community among several individuals, who in our opinion started already during the start
            of the pandemic when the need for something to do in connection with others without meeting physically grew
            strong. Cooking then became more of a interest and many therefore turned to a lot of different sites to find
            inspiration for what to cook for the day.
            That's why we came up with the idea of creating a platform that holds several recipes and that makes it even
            easier for applicants. Making it no longer a necessity to jump from website to website, as
            this website has already sampled a lot of recipes for you.</p>

    <p>
        When you create an account on Cooking-It, your own profile is included, this profile gives you access to
        detailed information about the website and what can be good to think about while using it. It also offers a
        guide on how to go about adding a recipe and has a logout button at the bottom of the page that makes it easy
        for you to logout from your profile. Then just look around the page to do what you are most interested in. If
        you use the menu at the top of the page, you will find all the pages available that will take you where you want
        to go. Of course it sounds exciting, scroll down a bit more and you can read about everything the website has to
        offer. If you already feel compelled, click on the button below to create your very own profile.

    <p>
        It's not just about food, it's about taking part and sharing what everyone has to offer. At least that's what we
        think. To begin with, as you may already know, you are offered a profile by creating an account. In this account
        you can read recipes that already exist, comment on them if you feel you want to try them, read other people's
        comments and if necessary also delete the comment you have already posted. In addition to that, you can add
        your own recipe yourself by following the menu at the top of the page or clicking on the button that is already
        in your profile, it's entirely up to you. All we wish for is that you find joy in this website and have fun
        while cooking.</p>
